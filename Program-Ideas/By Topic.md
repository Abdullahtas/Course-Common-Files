# Program domain ideas

What to write programs about?

## Simulations

* Library - Keeping a list of books available in the system, checking in and out books, patrons can have an array of books checked out at a time.
* Train station - Trains arriving and leaving the station, a queue of people lining up to board certain trains.
* Online shop - User can select items to buy, program keeps track of the array of items and the total, prints out a receipt once done.

## Computer Utilities

* File searcher - Write a program to search a text file for specific words, returns information like line number and the line it was found on.
* File system mapper - Use a recursive function to go through all the folders in a directory and build a text file with a list of those directories.
* Text editor or text reader - Write a program that reads text files and displays them to the screen. Implement pagination to make it a more accessible text reader.
Could implement bookmarks and such.

## Apps

* To-Do list - Have user keep a to-do list on their computer with a schedule, allow exporting the schedule to CSV file.
* Recipe - Allow user to store recipes, can type in a batch (ratio) to adjust the ingredient list.
* Card game - Implement a simple card game with boring-person cards (whatever the normal 52 card thing is called), or make a new card game (like MTG or Pokemon),
and write a program to implement the turns so two people can play.
* Quizzer - Use Polymorphism to store an array of Questions of different types (multiple choice, true-false, fill in the blank, etc.),
allow user to edit and save a question deck, and then run the quiz.

## Games

* Text adventure like Zork - Create an array of rooms, each room can have a neighbor to the North, South, East, or West. You can implement this via an
array or via pointers. Can also implement an inventory system, or a door-and-key system.

## Calculations

* Quadratic Formula - Calculate roots of a polynomial
* Square feet - Calculate the total square footage of a building, adding each room's dimensions
* Physics - For some acceleration, initial velocity, and initial position, calculate an item's position over time.
* Fractions - Write a Fraction class and overload math operators to handle fraction math.
* Distance - Calculate the distance between two objects.
* Moving at an angle - Use the trig functions to decide how much to modify an (x, y) coordinate pair based on the character's speed and the angle they're currently heading.

## Silly

* Random poetry generator - Based on some form ("Roses are red, violets are blue..."), generate random poetry with a list of nouns and adjectives.
